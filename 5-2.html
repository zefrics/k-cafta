            0.0.1. The categories of personal information we have collected about you.<br>
            0.0.2. The categories of sources from which we collect your personal information.<br>
            0.0.3. The business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling your personal information.<br>
            0.0.4. The categories of third parties with whom we share personal information.<br>

            <br>
            <span class="bold">0.2. To delete your personal information. If you make this request, we will delete the personal information we hold about you as of the date of your request from our records and direct any service providers to do the same. In some cases, deletion may be accomplished through de-identification of the information. If you choose to delete your personal information, you may not be able to use certain functions that require your personal information to operate.</span><br>
            <br>
            <span class="bold">0.3. To stop selling your personal information. We don’t sell or rent your personal information to any third parties for any purpose. We do not sell your personal information for monetary consideration. However, under some circumstances, a transfer of personal information to a third party, or within our family of companies, without monetary consideration may be considered a "sale" under California law. You are the only owner of your Personal Data and can request disclosure or deletion at any time.</span><br>
            <br>
            If you submit a request to stop selling your personal information, we will stop making such transfers.<br>
            <br>
            Please note, if you ask us to delete or stop selling your data, it may impact your experience with us, and you may not be able to participate in certain programs or membership services which require the usage of your personal information to function. But in no circumstances, we will discriminate against you for exercising your rights.<br>
